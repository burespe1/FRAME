# FRAME NEXT - Next Level of FRAME
The FRAME Architecture (originally called the European ITS Framework Architecture) was developed as a result of recommendations from the High Level Group on transport telematics, which were supported by a resolution of the Council of Ministers. It was created and first published by the EC funded project KAREN in October 2000. The underlying aim of this initiative was to promote the deployment of (mainly road-based) ITS in Europe by producing a framework which would provide a systematic basis for planning ITS implementations, facilitate their integration when multiple systems were to be deployed, and help to ensure inter-operability, including across European borders.

The development of the FRAME Architecture and the FRAME Architecture tool continous.<br>
If issues, questions or the need for information apears, this is the right place for it.

## Ongoing developments of reference architectures:<br>
Within the project [NAPCORE](https://napcore.eu/), with the main goal to harmonize the National Access Points (NAP) and National Bodies (NB) through 33 countries, the FRAME NAP reference Architecture faces an update procedure.
Therefore we established another GitHub repository:<br>
> NAPCORE National Access Point Reference Architecture<br>
> [NAP Reference Architecture](https://github.com/NAPCORE/NAP-Reference-Architecture)

> NAPCORE National Body Reference Architecture<br>
> [NB Reference Architecture](https://github.com/NAPCORE/NB-Reference-Architecture)
