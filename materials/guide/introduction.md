# Introduction

Today, Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) form an important technological and organisational basis in the application areas of road traffic. In addition, the importance of information and communication technology for the increasing networking of these systems is also growing and at the same time brings new challenges in the introduction and integration of new systems into existing ITS landscapes. To ensure "intelligent" mobility in Europe, the consistency of information and the associated integration of the corresponding systems are an indispensable prerequisite. This way, ITS is a powerful toolbox to reduce congestion and emissions and to increase the reliability, punctuality and safety of road traffic. To support and simplify the development and operation of ITS, the freely available FRAME Architecture will provide a tool to increase the supply of ITS and its innovation. Based on the experience of the parties involved in the project, the stability of ITS is to be increased and its development methodically supported by design recommendations.

The technical point of view is still often the centre of attention, when talking about creating an ITS service, because the whole service delivery was the responsibility of mainly one entity. However, because of the rapid changes in the ITS domain, this prerequisite applies less and less. The increasing opening of the domain to the private sector, driven by technological and political developments, demands an organizational change for future service creation and operation.

In addition to the technical point of view, the cooperation between the different types of actors that are increasingly becoming involved in the provision of mobility services in terms of content and organisation must also be considered. In fact, ITS services are generally offered jointly by several actors. For example, at national and regional levels road side information is often collected by many road operators, and may then be consolidated on a central platform of a service operator before being made available to navigation service providers. In this example, we therefore have many different actors involved in data collection, data preparation and the provision of an ITS service for an end customer. Each of the actors has its own architecture with its own internal goals, applications and processes. These viewpoints are represented in the ITS pyramid. The pyramid describes the architecture of the individual actors on a high abstraction level.

To be able to offer a common ITS service, the different actors must cooperate at a business level and collaborate on a technical level and their architectures should be interoperable at all levels of cooperation (see also [Figure 1](#_ref12284192)). The "business" part of the updated FRAME Architecture, consisting of Overall Concepts and an Organisational View, developed as part of this project will provide the corresponding implementation framework for the realization of comprehensive ITS architectures.

In the FRAME Architecture, basic definitions are made for concepts, standards and mechanisms necessary to ensure the interoperability of distributed communicating applications, components and organisations at different levels. Since terms are often used in different ways in a specific business context, the FRAME Architecture provides formal definitions in a glossary for common understanding. In particular, synonyms and homonyms can make it unnecessarily difficult for partners to communicate correctly and efficiently in practice. The "business" part of the updated FRAME Architecture will provide guidance to identify the business cases of all actors involved and help the actor tasked with the overall implementation to set up the corresponding organisational structures of the service delivery appropriately. Therefore, the definition of roles involved in the value creation chain need to be identified, together with their properties, like capabilities, goals and interests. Views are used to link the parties involved at the business process, value-added and governance levels in a target-oriented manner. This is supported by the Organisational View.


**FRAME Architecture Tool Structure**

A key feature of the FRAME NEXT project has been the introduction of a systematic approach for the inclusion of Business Views in FRAME sub-set architectures, which focus on the enterprise perspectives of ITS Services. This reflects the current paradigm shift in the ITS domain from the provision of technical systems to the delivery of business/public services. After identifying the enterprise (i.e. business/public service) aspects using a number of different headings, the latter were then revised according to the experience gained. The next step has been to devise a method to connect the results of this process with the current FRAME architecture, and to adapt the FRAME methodology accordingly.

FRAME as a term embraces three elements: methodology, architecture and tools. The FRAME Architecture is a repository of User Needs and functions, which are grouped into several Functional Areas. In the project FRAME NEXT, the methodology has been enriched by the possibility to extend the Overall Concepts, Organisational Views and Communications Views in a more systematic manner than before. 

The FRAME Methodology employs the FRAME Architecture while also utilising the building blocks, glossary and definitions to provide a clear procedure for the ITS architect to develop ITS service architectures. FRAME NEXT incorporates the building blocks for the Overall Concepts, Organisational View and some extensions to the Communications View into the FRAME Architecture and has amended the FRAME methodology accordingly. 

The last element is the FRAME Tool, which enables the ITS architect to create ITS architectures as sub-sets of the FRAME Architecture to implement one or more ITS services. In the FRAME NEXT project, this tool will be completely renewed and brought up to a state of the art technical solution.
